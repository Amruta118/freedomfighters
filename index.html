                <h1>Mangal Pandey</h1>
                <img src="images/mangalpandey.jpg" style="float: left;">
                <p>Mangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key role in the events taking place just before the
                    outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native
                    Infantry (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a
                    postage stamp to remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic
                    productions.
                    Mangal Pandey was born in Nagwa, a village of upper Ballia district, Ceded and Conquered Provinces
                    (now in Uttar Pradesh), to a Hindu Brahmin family.

                    Mangal Pandey had joined the Bengal Army in 1849. In March 1857, he was a private soldier (sepoy) in
                    the 5th Company of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry. On the afternoon of 29 March 1857, Lieutenant
                    Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, then stationed at Barrackpore was informed that
                    several men of his regiment were in an excited state.

                <h1>Chandra Shekhar Azad</h1>
                <img src="images/Chandrasekhar_Azad.jpg" style="float:right;">
                <p>Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, in a
                    Brahmin family, in the princely-state of Alirajpur. His forefathers were from Badarka village of
                    Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. His mother, Jagrani Devi, was the third wife of Sitaram Tiwari,
                    whose previous wives had died young. After the birth of their first son, Sukhdev, in Badarka, the
                    family moved to Alirajpur State.

                    His mother wanted her son to be a great Sanskrit scholar and persuaded his father to send him to
                    Kashi Vidyapeeth at Banaras to study. In 1921, when the Non-Cooperation Movement was at its height,
                    Chandra Shekhar, then a 15-year-old student, joined. As a result, he was arrested on 20 December. On
                    being presented before the Parsi district magistrate Justice M. P. Khareghat a week later, he gave
                    his name as "Azad" (The Free), his father's name as "Swatantrata" (Independence) and his residence
                    as "Jail". The angered magistrate punished him with 15 lashes.</p>

                <img src="images/Lokmanya_Gangadhar_Tilak.jpg" style="float:left;">
                <p>Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in
                    Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay
                    Presidency).[1] His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher
                    and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née
                    Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death. After marriage, her name was
                    changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan
                    College of Pune in 1877. He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the L.L.B course instead,
                    and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from Government Law College.[8] After graduating, Tilak
                    started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. </p>

                <h1>Jawaharlal Nehru</h1>
                <img src="images/Jnehru.jpg" style="float:right;">
                <p>The son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in
                    England—at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple.
                    He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began
                    to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined
                    the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s,
                    and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru
                    as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from
                    the British Raj.

                    Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the
                    secular nation-state in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the
                    elections, and to form governments in several provinces. </p>
